## Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify flower species from the Iris dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample belongs to one of three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib

## Workflow Summary

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.
- Normalized feature values using `StandardScaler`.
- Encoded target labels (already numeric).
- Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20).

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Model Architecture
- Input layer with 4 features
- Two Dense layers: 
  - Layer 1: 10 neurons, ReLU
  - Layer 2: 8 neurons, ReLU
- Output layer: 3 neurons (Softmax for multiclass classification)

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Training & Evaluation
- Model trained for 50 epochs
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Achieved accuracy above 95% on the test set

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Visualization
- Plotted training vs. validation accuracy and loss
- Helped monitor model performance across epochs

---

## Results
- **Final Test Accuracy:** ~96%  
- Model successfully distinguishes between the three Iris species  
- Training and validation curves show good generalization

---

## Files Included
- `iris_deep_learning.ipynb` â€“ Full code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation
